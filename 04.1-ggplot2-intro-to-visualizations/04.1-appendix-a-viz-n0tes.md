# Visualization notes

In the corporate world, when you kick off any kind of dashboard project, you should engage with stakeholders, meet with the people who will be using it, the people who own and/or govern the data, and others to get the full picture before you start analyzing and visualizing the data.

When it comes to producing something of value for your (internal or external) customer, ask yourself:

* What does the customer need?

* What do they want to know?
